# Note: GNU Backgammon (gnubg) is not available as a simple pip package
# It requires system-level installation. The AI service will use a fallback
# implementation that still supports difficulty levels (1-10).
# For production, GNU Backgammon can be integrated later via system installation
# or by using its command-line interface.
